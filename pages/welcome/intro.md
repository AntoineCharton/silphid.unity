*Silphid.Unity* is a high quality *.NET* library for the development of modern and fluid *Unity* applications leveraging *Reactive Extensions* (*Rx*) and the *MVVM* pattern, in order to achieve a fully dynamic, data-driven UI, advanced animation sequencing and transitioning, streamlined dependency injection, as well as asynchronous data loading, caching and conversion.

*Silphid.Unity* was inspired by my work of the past 17 years at [Simbioz](http://simbioz.com) and then [LVL Studio](http://lvlstudio.com), initially targeting the WPF framework, but now completely rethought and redesigned for [Unity](http://unity.com) and [Rx](http://reactivex.io).

Even though it has been used to deliver multiple commercial-grade applications, it is still constantly evolving and improving, and I am just now releasing it to the public for the first time. Documentation and examples are still in their early stages and more work still has to be done to make the whole thing easier to integrate into your Unity projects. But, as they say, we have to start somewhere! ;)  All your comments are more than welcomed!

My sincere thanks to [LVL Studio](http://lvlstudio.com) for supporting this effort and being such a great place to work at. If you are looking for an outstanding job opportunity in the Montreal area, make sure to visit our [Careers](http://lvlstudio.com/en/careers) page! :)
