## Note

*The following instructions are for importing the `.unitypackage` directly into your project's `Assets` folder. This is the simplest way to use the framework. However, if you intend to modify its sources, either for contributing or for evolving it in your own fork, please follow the instructions in the [Integrating as a Git submodule]({{"welcome/integrating-submodule" | relative_url}}) section instead.*

## Importing the package into your project

- Make sure your are running the latest version of Unity or at least *2017.2.x*
- Configure your Unity project:
  - In the Unity Editor menu, click *Edit > Project Settings > Player* and in *Other Settings > Scripting Runtime Version*, select *Experimental (.NET 4.6 Equivalent)*.
  - When prompted, select *Restart*.
- Download the latest release of the package from [GitHub](https://github.com/silphid/silphid.unity/releases/latest) (ie: `Silphid.Unity-20xx.x.x.unitypackage`)
- Drag the package file onto your *Project* window in the editor and click *Import*.
- Try the examples and look at the scripts for those examples (there are lots of comments there).  More examples coming soon.
