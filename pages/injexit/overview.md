*Injexit* is a simple dependency injection framework that I created as an alternative to [Zenject](https://github.com/modesttree/Zenject), a great dependency injection framework for Unity.  I love *Zenject*, it is very powerful, robust and mature, however I needed *Showzup* to be independent from *Zenject* and also needed some specific features that *Zenject* was lacking.  *Injexit* started as a minimalist container (with a single class!) and quickly evolved into a full-fledged framework with a clean and efficient fluent syntax.

I am planning to refactor *Showzup* to make it plug-and-play compatible with both *Zenject* and *Injexit*, so that you may choose either framework.
