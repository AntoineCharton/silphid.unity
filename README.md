# Silphid.Unity

*Silphid.Unity* is a high quality *.NET* library for the development of modern and fluid *Unity* applications leveraging *Reactive Extensions* (*Rx*) and the *MVVM* pattern, in order to achieve a fully dynamic, data-driven UI, state-machine page navigation flows, advanced animation sequencing and transitioning, streamlined dependency injection, as well as asynchronous data loading, caching, conversion, and so much more! :)

## Resources

Please, refer to the [online documentation](http://silphid.com/silphid.unity/) for instructions on how to setup and use the framework.

Also check out my new [blog](http://silphid.com/) on *mindful software design*, where I will use many examples from the framework's code base to illustrate great development techniques and design best practices ! :)

Mathieu
